There were more difficulties encountered than we can even begin to describe in this report.

The first difficulty was with SRTAT. Half of our team uses MacOS, and they were not able to run this program. We then moved on to C-SFRAT, which also did not work on MacOS. Neither software worked with the data provided, even when converted to a CSV file rather than the given DAT file. There was no information on what format the data needed to be in, leaving us to flounder and guess what the programs were looking for.

Moving on to the second half of the lab, even more difficulties were encountered. Once again SRTAT does not work on MacOS. Attemting to use RDC-11 also provided a new array of issues. The first one was the lack of instruction other than "fill in the data." There is no documentation on how the sheet works either from the createors or the teaching team. Every single set of failure data is in a different format, so we had no idea which one to use or how to use it. When we attempted to choose one and import the data into RDC-11, we found that the values we had were locked in the spreadsheet.

# Comments/feedback on the lab itself

This lab was incredibly frustrating and diffcult to complete. The expectations were incredibly unclear, and even when the students requested clarification, none was offered. This lab forced us to think outside of the box and find new ways to solve problems the course failed to prepare us for. In future years, reconsider this entire assignment and the software used. All of the software was incredibly outdated and was difficult if not impossible to use on a modern operating system.
